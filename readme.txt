1)	R_Final = ABC where A = R_z(alpha), B = R_y(beta), C = R_x(gamma)
2)	The roll and yaw perform the same action/rotation except the yaw rotates the plane around
	the y-axis clockwise and roll rotates counter clockwise around the y-axis. A similar
	phenomenon occurs when the pitch = 90
3)	The plane changes the direction it is rotating around the y-axis. It looks like it reflects to
	the other side of the y-axis. For when pitch = 90 it is hard to tell but it looks like this phenomenon
	does not happen.
